# surfs_up

## Overview
This analysis explored the weather conditions in Oahu, Hawaii that were stored in an SQLite database to determine if opeining up an ice cream and surf board shop there is feasible. Statistical analyses were performed to get an idea of the amount of precipitation and the temperature that can be expected throughout the year.

- The average temperature in June is a little higher than the average temperature in December
- The highest recorded temperatures for June and December (85 and 83 respectively) are extremely similiar
- The temperatures seem to vary more in December considering the larger range in temperatures

## Summary

According to the analysis, the weather for both June and December are very similar with December having more varying fluctuations in temperature. Its highest temperature is very close to June's but its lowest temperature is quite a bit lower.

Some additional queries that could be run to provide a more complete overview of the weather conditions could be to (1) run the same analysis for both months but for the amount of precipitation and (2) to run idential analyses for temperature for a spring and autumn month to get a better idea of how much of the year gets good weather.
